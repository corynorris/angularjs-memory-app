# AngularJS Memory App
## Overview
This is a very basic app that offers timed repetition memory services. There is an explanation
along with a demo which can be found [here](http://corynorris.github.io/angularjs-memory-app/app/#/intro)

## Contents
All of the code is done with `AngularJS` and can be found in the following folder:
`app/`

## Limitations
This app is meant as basic demo of my Angular knowledge and therefore has the following limitations:
 - Only uses local storage (for a RESTful backend, checkout my other projects)
 - Isn't efficient with memory, loads all memories each time you change pages
 - Doesn't load angular async (for code clarity)
 - e2e and unit test haven't been added
 
## Further goals
 - Animation or feedback when reviewing memories
 - e2e and unit test
